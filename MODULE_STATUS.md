# Module Status

Completion percentages are evidence-based estimates against
`VI_REACTIVATION_FINAL_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md`, not measures of code volume or visual polish. Existing
foundations are preserved; percentages increase only when real backend contracts, permissions,
audit behavior, UI integration, and tests are complete.

GOV-02 adds a completion gate without changing any percentage: new or materially changed screens
must also pass ADR-0012 and the twenty-point premium screen Definition of Done in Design Document
25. Visual polish alone never increases completion, and a backend-complete workflow with a generic,
inaccessible, placeholder-driven, or inconsistent experience is not final completion.

The owner-corrected CORE-05 extends the existing Reactivation and Task authorities with nine primary
statuses, six labels, governed dates, due views/actions, assignment, Audit and Timeline. CORE-07
converges those facts with identity, WhatsApp history, documents, tasks, KYC/SIM/Activation,
campaigns and evidence inside the existing Customer 360 route. Completed authorities are reused;
separate new heavy SIM fulfilment and Activation operations remain owner-deferred.

## Update rule

After each milestone, update only affected rows and their dependencies. Never lower a percentage to
hide a regression; record the regression as `FAIL` in `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` and pending work here.
Never mark a foundation-only shell complete.
