# Validation Results

> Status vocabulary is restricted to `PASS`, `FAIL`, and
> `PENDING – Host Machine Validation`. This ledger records the latest applicable evidence; it must
> be refreshed after every milestone. CORE-02 starting GitHub baseline: `16bd1c6`; the milestone
> adds the server-owned Vi domain foundation only. Canonical pre-merge, release, image, and isolated
> deployed-stack gates all passed.

## CORE-02 Vi domain foundation

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Domain records and constraints | PASS | All ten approved records are registered; tenant/contact/case uniqueness, fixed values, positive/ordered SLA constraints, serial uniqueness, and immutable histories are covered by model/migration tests. |
| Transition and prerequisite rules | PASS | Reactivation, KYC preparation/approval, SIM fulfilment, activation approval/completion, and SLA command tests passed; invalid/stale commands fail closed. |
| Idempotency and concurrency | PASS | Same-key/same-command replays return existing outcomes; mismatched reuse and stale row versions return conflict evidence in focused tests. |
| RBAC and tenant isolation | PASS | Fifteen additive permissions, role defaults, API denial, manager approval boundaries, public UUID scoping, and cross-tenant 404 behavior passed. |
| Audit, Timeline, and durable facts | PASS | Material commands atomically append audit rows, Customer Timeline projections, and existing-ledger business events without introducing a parallel authority. |
| Milestone boundary | PASS | No Reactivation Kanban, KYC workspace, SIM fulfilment UI, Activation Queue, fake data, placeholder workflow, duplicate CRM pipeline, document store, timeline, or event bus was added. |
| Focused CORE-02 tests | PASS | 6 focused service/API/migration tests passed, including migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade. |
| Deployed domain foundation | PASS | MySQL applied `0032`; API, Redis, Celery workers/beat, frontend, and nginx reached healthy state in the isolated ten-service stack. |

## CORE-01 navigation and product shell

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Permitted navigation catalogue | PASS | Six-item task rail, grouped More surface, shared create actions, honest maturity labels, and permanent scope guard passed focused and full-suite tests. |
| RBAC and excluded concepts | PASS | Permission-filtered navigation/create/search tests passed; Ads, Payments, Billing, marketplace, SaaS/multi-project, and commerce destinations remain absent. |
| Keyboard and focus behavior | PASS | Menus, command palette, and mobile drawer expose state, close on Escape where applicable, trap dialog focus, and restore invoking focus. |
| Responsive active states | PASS | Compact/expanded rail, secondary routes, and primary mobile-overflow routes passed focused tests; mobile targets are at least 44px. |
| Reference and originality review | PASS | Six paired full/viewport workflows were inventoried; authenticated 1280×720 shell, More, and command palette were compared without importing reference code or assets. |
| Authenticated browser smoke | PASS | Dashboard shell and factual downstream-error states rendered at 1280×720 with a 72px rail, 672px command palette, and no horizontal overflow. |
| Focused frontend tests | PASS | 30/30 navigation/foundation tests passed after the final responsive active-state correction. |
| Source/migration/API boundary | PASS | Product scope sources, all 31 migrations, OpenAPI JSON, and generated TypeScript contract are unchanged from the CORE-01 baseline. |

## GOV-02 documentation and governance

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Required governance files | PASS | All ten required root documents, ADR-0012, and Design Document 25 are present and non-empty. |
| Markdown structure and relative links | PASS | Heading/table structure and repository-relative Markdown links passed the GOV-02 static check. |
| Product-goal and priority consistency | PASS | Scope, rules, roadmap, tracker, ADR, and experience standard agree on the permanent target and ordered priorities. |
| Reference boundary and originality | PASS | Approved/conditional/prohibited categories, local-only ignore policy, fourteen-step review, and no-copy boundary are recorded consistently. |
| Exclusions | PASS | Ads, payments, billing/subscriptions, marketplace, reseller/multi-project, public signup, and commerce remain excluded. |
| No-placeholder and premium screen gate | PASS | Real-state rule, shared-component standard, continuous-quality boundary, and twenty-point Definition of Done are locked. |
| Changed-file boundary | PASS | GOV-02 changes only Markdown governance, ADR, and design files; no source, test, API, migration, configuration, or runtime file changed. |
| Reference library isolation | PASS | `.reference/` is locally ignored and no capture/archive file is tracked or staged. |
| Migration invariance | PASS | Migration head remains `0031_automation_trigger_receipts` with 31 linear revisions. |
| OpenAPI invariance | PASS | `frontend/openapi.json` remains OpenAPI 3.1.0 with 153 paths and is unchanged from the starting Git baseline. |

## Backend

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Pytest | PASS | Canonical release validation passed 936 backend tests in 406.78 seconds; pre-merge independently passed the same 936 tests. |
| Migration validation | PASS | Single head `0032_vi_domain_foundation`; 32 linear revisions; SQLite upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade and deployed MySQL upgrade passed. Generic SQLite `alembic check` remains non-authoritative because of pre-existing repository-wide reflection noise. |
| Ruff | PASS | Canonical pre-merge and release profiles passed Ruff across application, tests, scripts, and root tools. |
| Mypy | PASS | Canonical pre-merge and release profiles passed strict mypy across 252 backend source files. |
| Python compile | PASS | `compileall` passed for backend application/scripts and root scripts. |

## Frontend

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | PASS | Frontend and Playwright TypeScript checks passed in canonical pre-merge and release profiles with regenerated contracts. |
| ESLint | PASS | Frontend ESLint passed in canonical pre-merge and release profiles. |
| Vitest | PASS | Full suite passed 636/636 tests across 28 files. |
| Playwright | PASS | Isolated production owner login → queued CSV import → persisted contact search journey passed against the CORE-02 images in 11.3 seconds. |
| Production build | PASS | TypeScript and Vite production build passed after final source changes. |

## API

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAPI generation | PASS | Live generation and drift validation passed; OpenAPI 3.1.0 advanced from 153 to 182 paths (+29). |
| Generated TypeScript contracts | PASS | `npm run gen:api` regenerated the typed Vi contracts; frontend typecheck and drift checks passed. |

## Infrastructure

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | PASS | Development/production Compose models, ten-service release contract, production builds, backend/frontend image contracts, Trivy source/image scans, SBOMs, and isolated deployment passed. |
| Celery | PASS | Realtime, bulk, and jobs workers plus beat reached healthy state; the backend image retained 24 registered tasks and queued journey evidence passed. |
| Redis | PASS | Isolated Redis reached healthy state and supported the deployed queue/readiness journey. |
| Target production commissioning | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | TLS/host hardening, UAT, restore/rollback rehearsal, receiver delivery, and production approval require the target host. |

## Accessibility

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Existing responsive/keyboard baseline | PASS | CORE-01 focused tests and authenticated desktop browser review verified labelled controls, active state, focus management, 44px mobile targets, and overflow behavior. |
| Full final-scope WCAG regression | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | Must be repeated on every completed final-scope route with real domain data and the target browser/device matrix. |

## Performance

| Validation item | Status | Latest evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Standard-read canary | PASS | p95 16.5 ms across 30 authenticated reads, below the 300 ms budget. |
| Full load/stress/spike/soak and 1M-contact certification | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | Requires the isolated Performance Lab and production-like capacity. |

## Known limitations

| Validation item | Status | Current limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Target observability receivers | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | Log shipping, dashboards, alert firing/dead-man delivery, and external synthetic checks need deployed receivers. |
| Production frontend bundle | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | The main chunk warning is 713.18 kB; further route splitting remains a performance task. |
| Docker-backed source scan | PASS | Trivy vulnerability, secret, and IaC scan passed; production backend/frontend image vulnerability scans and CycloneDX SBOM generation also passed. |
| React Router advisories | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | Two moderate advisories require an explicit React Router 7.18+ upgrade milestone, not a silent dependency change. |
| Contact-scoped conversation history | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | `ConversationHistorySection.tsx` still exposes the known unavailable/TODO boundary. |
| Final domain workflows | PENDING – Host Machine Validation | CORE-02 supplies real Reactivation/KYC/SIM/Activation/SLA server authorities, but their complete operational UIs plus Notification Center, generalized approvals, Google Sheets, and Download Center remain later milestones. |

## Milestone closeout rule

A new result replaces prior evidence only after the exact command has completed. A failure remains
`FAIL` until rerun successfully. Environment-dependent checks stay
`PENDING – Host Machine Validation`; they must never be relabelled `PASS` from repository-only
inference.
